The survey covered many related topics as well and, as a result, the book provides an insight into public attitudes to virtually all aspects of death and the disposal of the dead. It is consequently a landmark study and will be of interest to a broad spectrum of those whose profession deals in any way with death, as well as to sociologists, historians, theologians and others interested in the place of funeral memorialisation and death in contemporary Britain.');
